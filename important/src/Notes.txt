React.memo :- It is a higher-order component (HOC) that wraps a functional component.
It memoizes the entire component and prevents unnecessary re-renders when props donâ€™t change.
Useful for pure functional components that always render the same output given the same props.

useMemo Hook :- It is a React Hook that memoizes the result of a function.
Prevents expensive calculations from running on every render.
Used to optimize computation-heavy operations inside a component.

useCallback Hook :-The useCallback hook is used to memoize functions so that they are not recreated on every render.
 It is useful when passing functions as props to child components, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
