Redux is a state management library used to manage and centralize application state.

1.Store :- The central location where the entire state of your application is stored. //Bank 
2.Action:-Objects that describe what happened. Must have a type property, which is a string describing the action.  
//Customer wants to deposit 
3.Reducer :-Functions that specify how the state changes in response to an action. (state, action )
4.Dispatch :- A method used to send actions to the store.
5.Subscribe :- A method to listen for state changes in the store.

Workflow of Redux 
User Action -> Dispatch Action -> Reducer -> Update Store -> UI Update

Principle of Redux :-
1.Single Source of Truth:-As whole application state is stored in a single tree, it makes debugging easy, and development faster.
2.State is Read-only:-The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This means nobody can directly change the state of your application.
3.Changes are made with pure functions :-  A reducer is a central place where state modification takes place. Reducer is a function which takes state and action as arguments, and returns a newly updated state.

Action :- An action is a plain object that describes the intention to cause change with a type property. It must have a type property which tells what type of action is being performed.
Actions and states are held together by a function called Reducer.

createStore(reducer, [preloadedState], [enhancer])

Basic Flow of Redux application

//Step 1
const initialState = { name:"REACT" };

//Step3
function reducer(state = initialState, action){                //It will receive state & action .
  console.log(action);

   if(action.type ==='UPDATE_NAME'){                           
    // state.name = action.value;                           //Never update state directly    
    const oldState = {...state};
    oldState.name = action.value;
    return oldState;                //This reducer function must return a state;                                                        
    
   }    
   return state;                            
                                //based on action ,return a state.                                           
}                                                                                       
//Step 4
const action = {
  type:"UPDATE_NAME",
  value:"JS"
  }

//Step 2
const store = createStore(reducer);

//Step 6
store.subscribe(()=>{
  console.log("Store Changed", store.getState());
});

//Step 5
store.dispatch(action);

console.log(store.getState());
